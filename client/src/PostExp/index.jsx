                  <p>Be honest, did you really read the full Terms of Service agreement and privacy ‘policy’? Did you realize that you had granted Spectre the rights to take photos and videos of you and to use them without restriction? Don’t worry if not, you are in the majority. Spectre takes privacy seriously as it can be very bad for business. If it is easy and uncomplicated for you to setup strong privacy controls, we get less of your data. So we use ‘dark design’ to influence your choice when considering privacy settings and especially when signing up to Terms of Service agreements.</p>
                  <p><q>"Small design changes, like a few extra pixels of padding or the tint of a button, can have large and unexpected repercussions."</q></p>

                  <p>The design of the user experience of digital technologies can have significant effects on the way we share data or interact with platforms, websites, commercial advertisers and political campaigners. </p>
                  <p><strong>Dark Design Patterns or Dark UX (user experience)</strong>, these design tricks are based on human psychology that are used to provoke or manipulate people into signing up for something, buying something, or giving away more personal information than they thought or intended. You’ve probably seen the “in high demand” or “only X amount left at this price” notices when shopping for things online. Or think about how "accepting tracking cookies" is far easier than going through numerous menus and sub-menus to opt out. Social media sites and apps use the infinite scroll and auto-play functions to nudge you into continuous engagement. </p>

                  <p>Political campaigns are know for using the same methods: seemingly innocent voter surveys on political issues to collect names, email addresses, phone numbers and other contact details for their voter databases. These are only a few examples of how apparently benign design choices can knowingly manipulate users. </p>

                  <h1>Biometric data</h1>
                  <p>Selfies are a defining feature of the digital age, but we usually don’t think about the data that can be extracted from them. Beyond just the time, date, location and your appearance, there is a wider data-set that can be gained from selfies that you upload: this is called a faceprint. The distances between your eyes, the width of your nose, the depth of your eye sockets, the shape of your cheekbones, and the length of your jaw line are all nodes that create your unique faceprint.</p>
                  <p><strong>Faceprints can be created from your selfies</strong> but also out of other photographs or video footage, such as videos posted online or CCTV recordings. Law enforcement, border control, and security agencies are interested in faceprint data for identification and verification. But so too are the advertising industry, political influencers, commercial businesses, and others.</p>
                  <p>What if relatively harmless applications of faceprints are also used to improve ways of monitoring your behavior, like where you go, when, and with whom? What if it can determine other characteristics about you, like what you think, your mood, IQ, and political or sexual orientations? Or what about when it’s used to fake a scene in an image or video that you were never part of?</p>

                    When Google Photos was released in 2015, its image recognition system <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/when-it-comes-to-gorillas-google-photos-remains-blind/"> labeled black people as gorillas</a>. In 2016, researchers discovered that LinkedIn searches recommended male names, so when users searched for someone named “Andrea”, they’d be ask if they meant “Andrew”, but not the other way around. PredPol, a popular predictive policing software used by over 50 police departments in the US, has been accused of perpetuating racist practices.</p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>How do the technologies around us end up this way?</strong> Unfortunately, it’s not a matter of simply the fault of the software developer or data scientist; the problem is much deeper. In the case of the Google Photos fiasco, Google’s image-classification system worked by using a large volume of training data. This training data, for example, contained thousands of photos of dogs, helping the system understand what a dog looks like, so when a user uploads a photo of her dog, the image will recognize it as such. The problem was that the training data included plenty of white faces but excluded a sufficient number of black faces, causing the system to mis-classify images of black people. In fact, researchers have discovered that several common facial recognition technologies work best on white men, then slightly less accurately for white women , even worse for black men, and worst of all on black women. </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Biased algorithms</strong> feed exclusionary and discriminatory practices, and they spread quickly and at scale. The result of biased algorithms can manifest themselves in any number of places in which algorithms are being used today: in determining eligibility for a loan, in determining the length of someone’s prison sentence, and in evaluating whether or not to hire someone for a job. How might algorithmic bias be affecting your life? Would you even know about it, when it’s baked so deeply into a particular system?
                        </p>

                  <p>When you search for something online, you are indirectly expressing a curiosity, an interest, or a need. Advertisers have figured this out, and used this insight to personalize our experiences on the Internet. The fact that we all see different news recommendations and different advertisements when we search online is because the information we are fed has been personalized to meet advertisers’ or campaigners’ ideas of what is most relevant to us. In this sense, the Internet we experience has been customized to each of us individually. The scope of this personalization even informs the ads delivered to our Internet-connected Smart TVs, political profiles amassed by campaigns, the texts and robocalls we may or may not receive, and sometimes even the snail mail that arrives in our physical mailboxes. </p>
                  <p>
                    How does this work? Technologies like cookies, browser pixels, and browser fingerprints attempt to capture our behaviors online. By tracking your visit from the ESPN website to a travel blog, an advertiser might infer that you are interested in sports and travel. Visiting websites related to floral centerpieces and gowns might lead an advertiser to conclude that you are part of an upcoming wedding. This sort of behavioral profiling extends to other domains as well. If you are using an online dating service and spend more time on profiles of people with tattoos or people of a certain racial background, the dating service may infer these underlying preferences and feed you such profiles to maximize your time using the service.</p>
                  <p>
                    How do we feel about our behavior being profiled online so companies can maximize the time we spend clicking, browsing, or shopping?</p>

                  <p>Spectre uses single task design philosophy , timed elements, progress bar and instant rewards mixed with a series of escalating moral dilemmas to keep you clicking so your personal data keeps flowing.</p>
                  <p>Apps aren’t just for music and ride-sharing anymore; increasingly, they are becoming tools for companies and political campaigns to raise money and win votes. One strategy that apps commonly employ to boost engagement and feed addiction is gamification. Gamification is the process by which the user experience is turned into a game.</p>

                  <p>In the political world, many prominent political campaigns (including the official Brexit app and Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign apps) used gamification to encourage users to spend more time on the app and, in the process, collect more data. App creators have spoken openly about the rich, personal data their apps collect: names, email addresses, address book contacts, political views, and more.</p>
                  <p>Users are motivated to accumulate points within the app by completing actions suggested by the campaign – like completing surveys, checking into a rally, or calling their representative about an issue as instructed by the app. Users with enough points can unlock badges, which feed a system of popularity within the apps. One review of one such political gamified app stated, “I’ve officially hit leader status. Wow! Hooked. As bad as a game! #addictionisbad #helpme...”</p>

                  <p>'OCEAN' stands for the set of traits (Openness, Contentiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) used by researchers to ‘measure' human personality, a process known as psychometric profiling. Insights into your personality can help marketers and political strategists promote their products or agendas. For example, individuals high in contentiousness tend to be efficient, organized, obedient, and disciplined, so advertisements that appeal to their sense of organization, competence, and respect for authority are believed to be effective on them. By appealing to these underlying traits, psychometrically-informed ads are thought to have the potential to be more persuasive than standard ads.

                    Social media platforms have access to all kinds of potentially useful data about voters, and this makes them great places for political campaigns to advertise. Political campaigns can use Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Google Search, and Snapchat to target you with specific ads based on categories like your age, location, and gender. But they can also use very specific information such as what kind of content you engage with on their platforms, including what you ‘Like’ or comment on.* As the important details of micro-targeting are the business secrets of the individual platforms, we simply do not know enough about all of the factors that go into how users are selected for such finely segmented groups and then micro-targeted with ads.</p>
                  <p>
                    What we do know is that social media platforms offer special services specifically for political campaigns. Both Facebook and Google allow political campaigns to upload their voter contact lists to the platforms so they can send targeted ads just to the people on those lists. On top of that, it is also possible to target people with “similar profiles” to the voters on their lists. In politics alone, many thousands of ads are being delivered to an unknowable amount of segmented, micro-targeted lists, making it almost impossible to gain a full picture of how far microtargeting extends.</p>

                    Synthesized video means video and moving image clips in which elements of its content are purposely manipulated, sometimes using AI and machine learning. The most widely referenced category of synthesized video is the “deepfake”, in which a person in a video, usually their face or their voice, is replaced with that of another.

                  <p>AI and machine learning techniques have dramatically increased the quality of such manipulations, in some cases making the edits either difficult to spot or appear astoundingly real. While deepfakes can have light-hearted, humorous or benign intentions – replacing the face of a celebrity with that of another in a short clip, for example – they are also frequently used in fake celebrity or revenge pornography. There are also cases where creators of deepfakes have attempted to discredit journalists or politicians.
                     </p>
                  <p>
                    While there is legitimate concern that deepfakes could be used in adversarial politics –such as making a politician say and do things on video that are purposely faked – a more immediate concern remains relatively “low-grade” but effective shallow fakes or cheapfakes. Here, the deception is not based on a sophisticated AI and machine learning approach but is instead replaced with basic false attribution of a video’s source, context or data and time. There are already examples of violence and misinformation having spread from relabeled, re-uploaded, or marginally altered video content.
